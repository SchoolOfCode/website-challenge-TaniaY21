            <h2>All about me</h2>
            <p>I currently work as a customer service advisor for a Housing Association, which involves call handling,
                responding to emails, social media management and problem solving.
                I have been doing this for just over a year.</p>
            <h2>Why did you want to join the school of code?</h2>
            <p>I wanted a career change but did not know where to start. I was unsure about self teaching as I did not know if I was going in the right direction.
                I also wanted the support, and guidance, and wanted to develop the required workplace skills.
            </p>
            <h2>What do you hope to achieve by doing the school of code?</h2>
            <p>I hope to achieve the skills to take me into a career in front end technology. I want to learn how to
                study effectively and how to solve any technical coding problems using the correct resources. I would
                like to also achieve the confidence and connections to do this.
            </p>

            <h2>What do you do to manage time and learning schedule? </h2>
            <p>I make to-do lists and work through it each day. I tend to go back and forth as I learn better this way.
            </p>

            <h2>What are you planning to do once the course is over?</h2>

            <p>Once the course is over I would like to go into a front end development. Also, depending on what I learn
                throughout this course I will add more skills and take on extra courses that will help me improve
                (such as UX design and possibly some backend work to feel more rounded and have a sense of how
                everything is put together).
            </p>

            <h2>What would you like to be doing in five years time? </h2>
            <p>In five years time I would love to work with a fashion/make-up/online retail brand working on their
                website and how it looks and functions. I would ideally like to be
                 working remotely with trips to the main office for meetings and planning sessions. I would like to be
                able to work and travel all over the world at the same time.
